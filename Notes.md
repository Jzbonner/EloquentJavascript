Fundamental Notes on the Program Structure of Javascript

## Values, Types and Operators
A very good resource for reviewing basic building tools of JavaScript data types can be found at: [JavaScript W3School] (https://www.w3schools.com/js/) and at [MDN JavaScript] (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics). Both of these resources will prepare you for understanding some of the more detailed concepts discussed later in this book.
