## Javascript and the Browser 
> Web technology has been decentralized from the start, not just technically but also in the way it evolved. Various browser vendors have added new functionality in ad hoc and sometimes poorly thought-out ways, which then, sometimes, ended up being adopted by othersâ€”and finally set down as in standards.

## Networks and the Internet 
For information on the basics behind Network Protocols, Hypertext Transfer Protocols (HTTP), Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), the World Wide Web (WWW), Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Javascript, and Browser Compatibility please refer to [Ch. 13 of Eloquent Javascript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/13_browser.html)
